# This test is for the getEdges and addEdge methods

# Create a new Graph, g
created graph g

# Add a new Node, n1 to g
added node n1 to g

# Add node n2 to g
added node n2 to g

# Add node n3 to g
added node n3 to g

# Add edge from n1 to n1
added edge n1ton1 from n1 to n1 in g

# Add edge from n1 to n2
added edge n1ton2 from n1 to n2 in g

# Add edge from n1 to n3
added edge n1ton3 from n1 to n3 in g

# Add edge from n2 to n3
added edge n2ton3 from n2 to n3 in g

# Add edge from n2 to n1
added edge n2ton1 from n2 to n1 in g

# List the children of n1
the children of n1 in g are: n1(n1ton1) n2(n1ton2) n3(n1ton3)

# List the children of n2
the children of n2 in g are: n1(n2ton1) n3(n2ton3)

# List the children of n3
the children of n3 in g are:
