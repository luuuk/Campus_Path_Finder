Problem 6.

(a)
    Fib threw an IllegalArgException when n<=0, which should have been n<0. Changed n<=0 to n<0.

(b)
    Test base case failed initially because it was being forced to test 0. No change was necessary because fixing the
    IllegalArgException in part a also fixed the base case.

(c)
    There were two problems causing the inductive courses to fail. First, I changed the subtraction of the
    two terms to addition because the Fibonacci sequence is additive. Secondly, I changed the second test from
    n<=2 to n<2 as this was causing the value 2 to return 1 which is incorrect.

Problem 7. 

(A) Changed volume = volume to this.volume = volume to avoid identifier issues.
    Had getVolume method return field volume instead of 0.

(B) I think the second approach is a better option, as it keeps track of the total volume and
    requires fewer computations from the program. It will have a shorter runtime than looping through the whole set.

(C) One way you could implement getBalls in sorted order is to sort the set of balls upon insertion of each individual
    ball. This would involve adding a loop and test in the add() method so that each individual ball is inserted at
    the right spot. Another method would be placing all the balls in a TreeSet in the getBallsFromSmallest() method.
    This would be slightly less efficient as it would require more space and another iteration over the original set,
    but it is easier to read as it keeps the ugly sorting stuff out of the add() method.
